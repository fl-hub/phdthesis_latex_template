<h1>PhD thesis Template</h1>
I created this LaTeX template for my PhD thesis.
This document follows the University of Vienna guidelines.

Feel free to use and alter the template to your liking but beware of your university guidelines.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>If you are a University of Vienna student:</p>
<p>Go to the "Cover" folder and use the .doc to alter your front cover. Export it as a pdf called "cover.pdf" and add it to the main folder. This is the folder where main.tex is located.</p>
<p>You may want to check if the .doc is still up to date. Check it with your department.</p>
<p>Replace the "reflib.bib" with the one generated from your bibliography manager. I recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>.</p>

<h6>Disclaimer: this is not an officially supported template from the University. I created it by myself and to use on my own thesis.</h6>

<p>If you are a student from another University</p>
The same technique could be done using a pdf with the front cover mandatory by your university. Otherwise, you can also remove the line for the front cover import and change it with one made by you.
